# Dataset 1: Hair and Eye Color
For the first assignment we want to analyze the preinstalled R dataset "*HairEyeColor*".
Before getting started, we should set the working directory and load the data set.

```{r}
# Setting the working directory
setwd("C:/Users/Lisa/Documents/GitHub/CollaborativeDataAnalysisChristopherAndLisa/Assignment_1")
# Load student hair and eyecolor data and pass it into a dataframe
data("HairEyeColor")
HairEyeColor_dataframe <- data.frame(HairEyeColor)
```

For exploring the dataset, we should familiarize ourselves with it. The data set has `r NCOL(HairEyeColor_dataframe)` variables and `r NROW(HairEyeColor_dataframe$Hair)` observations. It includes the following variables: `r print(1,)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary("HairEyeColor_dataframe")
```
